## Things that  I want to demonstrate here:

1. __Color order algorithm:__
Being able to setup a gulp configuration with running unit test, test coverage and sass.
The front end will have a simple interface where you can input a bunch of hex Code colors once ready it will be reordered in a logical color sequence.
The logical color sequence algorithm will be hosted on the backend and made available through REST Web Services.
Language used is still to be determined.
